        <h1>Warm Beginnings - 5/30/2020</h1>
        <p>
            Lately, the state of the world has been bringing us closer to unity in ways
            I have yet to experience in my young adult life. The global pandemics, covid-19 and
            systemic racism, have been stirring the waters of a revolution. I find it difficult to
            locate myself during these times but also my role seems ever more lucid. I feel as 
            though I am floating aimlessly through 2020 and that has given me time to create 
            my own direction. <br />
            I'd like to develop platforms for global change: platforms for unionizing and creating
            art that tackle our changing human condition. These platforms cannot be gentle. I am aware
            that this is not something I can do alone and I hope that today during the black lives matter protests in Columbia, SC I can
            make connections with local leaders and activist to see how I can use my scientific training
            to improve their outreach and long-lasting comradery.<br />
            In my political space I'm starting to feel present. The rebellion in Minnesota has demonstrated
            that we must not hide from our oppressors but rather burn them to the ground in any which way possible. 
            My emotional and artistic location have also landed near the same perimeter: pressured by 
            change and the absolute necessity of confidence. I have been breaking down the barriers that have been keeping
            me from creating art that is honest and raw. <br />
            As my first blog post, I hope to use this text as a reference point for my growth this summer and
            through out my time using this internet space. I must hold myself accountable for the changes I wish to make. <br />
            Currently, I am working on developing an EP where I can get in tune with the frustrations I have with my placement
            in time and space and all of the horrific events that continue to occur. In a future blog post I hope to share
            these songs with you all aswell as the processes I have implemented to make this project breathe. <br />
            In addition to making music, I am also trying to keep myself reading. Currently, I am working through the novel <i>Lincoln in the Bardo</i>
            by George Saunders, the essay "Time is the Thing a Body Moves Through" by T Fleischmann, and a collection of poems 
            <i>How to Be Drawn</i> by Terrance Hayes. I will chronicle my time with these books on my blog and I hope to continue 
            to gain insight into human life and how to approach the horrors we face and create.
