Toxic masculinity takes place in a lot of different and contexts and directly threatens the safety and prosperity of minority cultural groups. By looking at how masculine females respond to and make sense of behaviors of toxic masculinity, I hope to offer insight on a new masculinity that ensures the well-being of minority groups. As a result of this study I hope to better understand the origins and forms of toxic masculinity and how female masculinity can be placed beside and against it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c4">Being raised with one gender identity, absorbing the norms and restrictions, and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">experiencing the attached violence, and then later moving towards another gender identity is a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">form of rebirth. Many transmasculine people are absorbing masculinity and relearning how to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">perform their gender in social settings at a later developmental stage period than cis-men. This</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">group has a particularly interesting perspective on masculinity because of their, sometimes</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">drastic, shift in identity and because the ways their gender patterns have been internally adjusted</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">and also externally mandated. Unlike a child learning masculinity for the first time, this group is</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">able to reflect on certain masculine traditions before committing to them. I am interested in how</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">these individuals make meaning of toxic-masculinity.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c4">Since the 1970s, theorists of feminist literature have considered gender to be an act, or becoming, a social norm that can be &ldquo;done&rdquo; and &ldquo;undone&rdquo; (Dozier, 2018). West and Zimmerman</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">(1987), in their influential essay, coin the phrase &ldquo;doing gender&rdquo; to describe interactions where</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">certain gendered roles are performed to maintain a gender hierarchy. They add, however, that</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">interaction is not the only place where gender hierarchy is established, but is one part of the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">system meant to actualize the unequal status of the woman. To West and Zimmerman gender is</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">the performance mandated by someones biological sex. Judith Butler (1990), who coined the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">phrase &ldquo;gender performativity,&rdquo; responds to West and Zimmerman by going further and breaking</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">the necessity to tie gender and sex. Additionally, Butler claims that looking at the borders of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">gender can reveal possibilities for radical societal change. Following Butler, Jack Halberstam</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">(1998) introduced the term &ldquo;female masculinity.&rdquo; He challenged the border between femininity</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">and masculinity that Butler claimed, and went further to discuss the visibility of masculine</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">females, complexity of their identities, and the hope that this new form of masculinity can offer a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">new way to structure our gendered understandings.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c4">Today, female masculinity has much more representation in pop culture and carries with</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">it a lot more discourse. With their visibility have come new understandings of female</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">masculinities and the borders have arguably expanded even further. Masculine females have</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">more of a space in male dominated social groups and communities which allows us to further</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">study how this new masculinity is changing traditional norms.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Research Purpose</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c4">As a result of this study, I hope to better understand the origins and forms of toxic</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">masculinity and be able to implement these understandings into proposals of new action. I also</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">hope to better understand not just the revolutionary successes of female masculinity, but also</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">how these understandings take place in the individual, and construct a non-toxic form</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">of masculinity from sharing their experiences through this study.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my intellectual goal of the study, I seek to understand the process of shifting into social masculinity from social femininity. Specifically, I hope to highlight how toxic masculinity is responded to by those who are learning masculinity through their transition in their adulthood. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Major Research Question</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c4">I focus the project around three main research questions: (1) How do masculine females within the ages of 18 and 24 in Atlanta make sense of their own masculinity when confronted with toxic-masculinity when in conversations/spaces with masculine identifying cis-men? (2) How is the experience of speaking with cis-men different from conversations that happen in their respective queer organizations? (3) How do these conversations unfold in each individual&rsquo;s setting?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Type of Study (Methodology)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">To be able to deeply understand this group of those who identify with female masculinity and their process of socialization I plan to conduct an ethnographic research study. Because of the length of time and immersion in the cultural group that an ethnography necessitates, I will be able to get significant detail to interpret the phenomenon I am focused on. To answer my research questions, especially the first question on how the participants make sense of their own masculinity and gendered socialization, I will need to spend a lot of time with my participants especially in their own contexts since I am most interested in how their gender manifests in their personal setting.</span></p><p class="c8 c6"><span class="c3">Conceptual Framework</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Review of Related Research</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c4">In this study, I am assuming Jack Halberstam&rsquo;s understanding of the role of female</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">masculinity in the construction and improvements to social situations. Halberstam (1998), writes</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">that &ldquo;women have made their own unique contributions to what we call modern masculinity&rdquo; and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">&ldquo;what we recognize as female masculinity is actually a multiplicity of masculinities&rdquo; (46). I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">understand this to mean that female masculinity is not only present but efficacious. I am also</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">assuming that both male and female masculinities are assembled from the same kinds of social</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">constructions (Halberstam, 1998).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c4">Key findings in research on female masculinity outline the benefits of female masculinity as a teacher. Bettina Love (2017) studied black female masculinity as a form of teaching young black men that steps away from traditional masculine norms and their toxicity. In this study, and others like it, female masculinity is proposed to be an identity that offers revolutionary progress and hope. Research is also done on how female masculinity deconstructs, undoes, and challenges</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">harmful gender norms. In their study, Dozier (2018) interviewed 49 masculine females from</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">different backgrounds and demonstrated how gender is undone in the workplace. This researcher</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">is especially interested in the role of appearance and challenging the anatomical basis of gender.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Other studies, focus on how women utilize certain characteristics of masculinity in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">certain contexts for safety and respect. Silje Louise Dahl (2015) studied new masculinities</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">formed from female cannabis consumption. They are interested in how women perform in male</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">dominated situations and how their behaviors reflect where they view themselves in the gender</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">hierarchy. This study focuses less on masculine females and more on females incorporating</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">masculine traits into social settings.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c4">A lot of studies done on female masculinity seek to make generalized statements on</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">femininity and what it means to be a woman. I want to expand the scope to include the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">perspectives of identities that are not easily placed into a binary.My goal is to contribute to the study of healthy masculinity in women and gender studies.The study will also provide a platform for butch voices to share not just their experiences with men in a work setting or otherwise, but a place to interpret their own shift into masculinity andthe process in which it occurred. I will also not just contribute to the understanding of female masculinities, but also I hope to offer new findings on the shift from femininity to masculinity. Not just the identity, but also the motion that comes with the identity, as female masculinity can never be static.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Conceptual/Theoretical Perspectives</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c4">The theoretical perspectives I outline in this proposal, those of Butler and Halberstam,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">heavily impact how I create my studies. I use their framework to understand how gender can be</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">presented in individuals and I use their ontological and epistemological framework on how</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">masculinity and femininity exist. Butler&rsquo;s work mostly informs me on the context of gender in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">feminism, philosophy, and literature and Halberstam&rsquo;s work informs me specifically about</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">female masculinity and its position in film and on gendered borders.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c4">While I do agree with and support these theorists, I note how these perspectives can be</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">rather limiting as the participants of the study might understand their gender differently. To</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">handle this theoretical and actual discrepancy, I plan to stay open to and explicitly ask how each</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">person thinks of gender, its construction, and its ontology. The theoretical perspectives thus</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">provide support and a framework but this framework is flexible by its very nature.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c4">Female masculinity is a difficult term because of its placement within the border wars</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">between butch and transgender as Halberstam (1998) describes in his essay, &ldquo;Transgender</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Butch&rdquo; (141). When I use female masculinity, I, on a naive scope, am thinking of female as a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">biological term,and gender as a social construction. I agree with the split between gender and sex</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">that Butler (1990) notes and I agree with the outline of the set of problems she offers (9).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">I am working under the notion that female masculinity is complex, the combination of the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">feminine and masculine can take on many different patterns and it is unlikely that two people</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">experience female masculinity in the same way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Situated Knowledge and Related Assumptions</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c4">As someone who identifies as a masculine female, I chose this topic because, like the participants, I am in the stage of learning masculinity in my twenties from men who have identified with masculinity throughout their entire lives. When speaking to my cis-male friends I am frequently faced with dilemmas regarding how I should perform &mdash; Should I speak out against the objectification and mistreatment of women and demonstrate that my masculinity is different or even in their perspective, incomplete? Should I pick up and condone the toxic masculine behaviors to feel safe and that my masculinity is respected? &mdash; I hope to understand how others who are experiencing a similar process respond and make sense of the decision to either adopt or reject toxic masculinity. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c4">The research topic is in many ways autobiographical to my personal life: My journey with female masculinity started with coming out as a lesbian when I was fourteen-years-old and getting kicked out of my home by my parents. I got involved with a lot of queer youth organizations as well as other homeless youth spaces where I first got to interact with the topic of female masculinity. In my senior year of highschool, I started to question and interact with my gender orientation, eventually coming out as nonbinary and using they/them pronouns. I started to get involved with not only queer organizations; but, specifically transgender support groups. This topic and the issues it addresses have been the main themes of my life in terms of understanding myself in relation to my family and my peers &mdash; Most importantly, I have been teaching others how to view me as a transgender person for three years now and have been critically thinking about masculinity in myself and in the people I am around. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c4">In addition to my experiences, my academic studies have heavily informed how I frame the phenoma I am chasing. In college, I began to study queer and feminist theory by reading Judith Butler, Jack Halberstam, and Michel Foucalt. My personal studies have provided me with a strong theoretical grounding on female masculinity and gender as a performance. These readings and respective discussions provide my entire framework for understanding the ontological and epistemological nature of gender. My academic work in queer theory and my experiences are inseparable from one another as each strengthens my understanding of the other. These connections are at play in my study and will manifest in how ask questions on gender and especially the terminology I use with my participants and in my writing. My interest in queer theory has primarily taken the form of reading critical theory texts and not sociological and qualitiative studies. Because of my lack of familiarity with sociology and understanding queerness as human experience rather than a metaphysical phenomena, I am challenged to critique impersonal understandings of queer theory that I am habitually drawn to.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c3">Design and Methodology</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Methodological Approach</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">For this study, I am conducting ethnographic research; this type of research entails deep immersion in a cultural group with their own set of beliefs and understandings done in order to gain rich descriptions and intensely reflective interpretation. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Site selection, criteria, and justification</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c4">My proposed site for this study is Atlanta, Georgia because it is in the south, has many queer organizations and social clubs, and is ethnically diverse. Additionally, my experiences with queer groups in Atlanta, Georgia have been extremely insightful for my structuring of this project because of my subjective position in the community.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c4">To choose the site, I am using the critical case selection strategy to find a few groups that can offer the most to the development of knowledge and theory on female masculinity through logical generalization. I choose critical case selection strategy over other strategies since I am looking for information rich but generalizable data to serve my intellectual goal to understand how individuals make sense of their own masculinity and its context.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c4">&nbsp;I am specifically looking for a site that has a strong queer social and politically active community because the particpants are familar with eachother and have education on and engagement with political issues like misogyny and patriarchal oppresion. I do, however, want to focus on a group in southeastern US over a group in New England or California because of the individual&rsquo;s necessary interactions with power imbalances from anti-queer laws and politically conservative law makers as well as personal experiences with hegemonic masculinity being celebrated and enforced by individuals in their social circles. Since queer groups in these politically conservative areas have to be especially well organized and engaged to combat blatant administrative oppression using techniques shared by queer groups all over the country, they serve as a critical case of the phenomena. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Participant selection, criteria, and justification</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c4">The participants of the study must identify with a masculine female identity. This identity is not restricted by sexuality or gender identity. For example, both bisexual women and transgender men can be participants even though their sexuality and gender identity may be different. This study will also focus on individuals in the age range of 18 to 24 living in the United States. The participants will all have experienced masculinity in a different way and have experienced forms of masculinity that are bound by race relations, socioeconomic status, educational backgrounds, and familial support systems.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c4">I am using the homogeneous case selection strategy to select the participants of my study since I am specifically trying to deeply understand a subgroup through their own perspectives and not from the various other players involved in the site. The participants of this study are selected by their constructed identity to create a group that is homogeneously made up of those who identify with female masculinity. The participants must be involved with a queer organization and be within the ages of 18 and 24. My proposed group of around twenty particpants will live in Atlanta, be involved with a queer community in the city, and will be homogeneously made up of those with masculine female identities.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Methods</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c4">I plan to conduct one or two interviews with each of my twenty participants and hold three-to-five focus groups with subgroups of the participants. I also plan on attending meetings with queer organizations and taking observational notes on how identity and safety is discussed in the meeting. To answer my first research question (1), I will look mostly towards interview and focus group transcripts as well informational documents from queer organizations in Atlanta, Georgia. I intend to ask specific questions to understand how my participants make sense of their own masculinity during interviews and focus groups. Quotes and stories from my participants are going to be the most important documents to answer this question since I am looking for their personal subjective perspectives. To answer the second research question (2), I will be looking at the documents from the first question but mostly comparing them to observation notes on how members of the community speak to each other by sitting in on their queer organization&rsquo;s group meetings and analyzing the focus groups for speech patterns and comfort levels. I also intend on looking at documents that describe the queer organizations and the safe spaces they seek to maintain. To answer my third question (3), I need transcriptions that outline the process that conversations follow in specific stories shared by the participants in the interviews and focus groups. I will also look at available art or zines made by members of the organization to get a more interpretative perspective on how interactions between participants and others unfold.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c4">In both focus groups I plan to ask these (potentially adjusted) questions/prompts: Tell me about the people you spend most of your time with. For example, describe their political affiliations, social circles, and occupations; How would you describe the gender dynamics of your friend group/ social circle?; How do you respond to behaviors of toxic-masculinity, like direct violence or just like conversational misogyny, when confronted with them in your social settings? A potential meeting I could attend is one from a local college that is intentionally chosen because it is discussion based and covers a topic that is similar to my project&rsquo;s topic. At this meeting and from the participants in my study I could collect informational pamphlets that organizations give to their members at meetings and disperse at events.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c4">To demonstrate the connections between the research questions, data collection methods, and study participants I have included a chart below that highlights these relationships.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">DCDM Chart</span></p><a id="t.9832985bae06a2ab079b4bf40dd00798631b0a8b"></a><a id="t.0"></a><table class="c22"><tbody><tr class="c10"><td class="c19" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c3">Research questions</span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c3">Participant Group (1):</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c14">Leaders of queer organizations &nbsp;who identify with female masculinity</span></p></td><td class="c20" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c3">(2):</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c14">Non-leader members of a queer organization who identify with female masculinity</span></p></td><td class="c17" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c3">(3):</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">Those who identify with female masculinity who are not very politically active but have interest</span></p></td><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c3">Documents:</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">Flyers, pamphlets, brochures etc. from the queer organizations</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c10"><td class="c19" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c7">(1) How do masculine females within the ages of 18 and 24 in Atlanta make sense of their own masculinity when confronted with toxic-masculinity when in conversations/spaces with masculine identifying cis-men? </span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Interview and focus group transcripts</span></p></td><td class="c20" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Interview and focus group transcripts</span></p></td><td class="c17" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Interview and focus group transcripts</span></p></td><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Documents from organization about safety, toxic-masculinity, and standing up against harassment</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c10"><td class="c19" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c7">(2) How is the experience of speaking with cis-men different from conversations that happen in their respective queer organizations? </span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Observation notes and focus group transcripts</span></p></td><td class="c20" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Observation notes and focus group transcripts</span></p></td><td class="c17" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Interview and focus group transcripts</span></p></td><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Document describing the organization and the kind of enviornment it seeks to construct for queer individuals</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c10"><td class="c19" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c7">(3) How do these conversations unfold in each individual&rsquo;s setting? </span></p></td><td class="c0" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Interview and focus group transcripts</span></p></td><td class="c20" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c7">Interview and focus group transcripts</span></p></td><td class="c17" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c7">Interview and focus group transcripts</span></p></td><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c5"><span class="c4">Art projects or zines from queer organizations</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c1 c18"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Data Analysis</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">To study my results, I plan to analyze interview transcripts, focus group notes, and documents using an ongoing reflective process by redesigning the project and data collection methods after reflecting on data already collected. Using my written documents, I will outline major themes using coding strategies as well as keep track of comments that surprised me or had me wanting to explore new themes. To begin my research I will search for general themes like family, being trasngender, and gender dysphoria and reflect on these themes and how they appeared during my coding project and how I can change interview and focus group questions to discuss new interesting themes. To inform my data analysis process I am focusing mostly on the data analysis and interpretation strategies and tips outlined by Bogdan and Biklen. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Role of the Researcher</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c4">In this study, my experience as a non binary immigrant with post traumatic stress disorder is a strength. I understand how a lot of conversations about abuse manifest from talking to friends and interacting with people in the queer and activist community. I can build rapport with participants to get insight on their stories and understandings while providing a safe space to discuss problems of misogyny and violence. Being an insider for this study is a strength in many aspects but can also lead to difficulties that I must confront and be cautious of. While I do not plan on approaching the project liberally, meaning allowing space for white supremacy and misogyny to get reasoned with, I must be able to interact with concepts and behaviors that I emotionally respond to and do not immediately understand</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Trustworthiness</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c4">To monitor my subjectivity and positionality I plan on memoing every time I interact with the project, whether it be by reading literature or conducting an interview. These memos would explicitly discuss my personal experiences that are similar to those of my participants and my emotional responses to their stories. This is a way for me to monitor my affective bias. I will also keep a personal journal where I reflect on my day including how my gender was interacted with. The personal journal which will include narrative writing, poetry, and visual art will help me keep track of my experiences with toxic masculinity and how I respond qualitatively</span></p><p class="c8 c6"><span class="c3">Study Implications</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Ethical Issues</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Because I am a member of the participant group and plan to do an ethnographic study, I must determine how much of my research identity to reveal with my participants. The downside to sharing my research identity when I am in the field participating at events or in group discussions about sensitive topics is that the participants might feel uncomfortable speaking to me authentically. I do think however, that it is necessary to reveal my research identity to my participants in order to feel like I am treating my participants respectfully and ethically. Trying to hide my research identity would be the source of many ethical issues involved in my study and I seek to control those situations by being open and honest about what I am trying to understand and why. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Risks and benefit</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Participating in my study has both risks and benefits for the participants. One benefit is having a chance to share their stories and reflect on themselves and their relationship with gender. Another benefit is that their stories can be used and shared to improve gender relations in a capacity that they could not do alone. A possible risk for the participants is that the study does not seek to be anonymous. Because I think it is difficult to hide your identity when you are a masculine female, word can easily get spread around the community that they are participating in this study. Some topics, like ones about violence, might also make participants uncomfortable and socially anxious. This risk will be prevalent in the interviews and focus groups I conduct, however I think that this space would be a therapeutic environment and a place where participants can process violence by deconstructing it and reflecting on how things could be different.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Limitations/Considerations</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Because I am using a self selecting sample for this study, I will be limited to those who identify with female masculinity and my research will not include those who are not comfortable with identifying with that term but might be in the community and would otherwise be excellent for the study. Another limitation I might find is that the participants might be uncomfortable in a research setting and in order to keep this factor from affecting me as much as possible I will need to constantly need to reflect on the academic nature of the environments I am creating. Lastly, it is also important to consider that topics surrounding gender are sensitive and often convoluted with painful memories. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Significance/Contributions</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c14">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">In the research field on female masculinity and toxic masculinity, my main contribution will be my focus on the socialization process that masculine females undergo to perform their respective gender identity. The focus on the socialization process will give the study a unique edge to targeting toxic masculinity because learning and processing is what I am seeking to study. This will contribute to the research field by being a unique combination of theoretical frameworks. My final project as a result of the study, whether it be a research paper or a creative project, will contribute to larger queer studies and the development of programs to enforce healthy masculinity.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1 c18"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">References</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Dahl, S.
