                <h2>IDENTITY</h2>
                <p>
                     My identity is one in constant motion. My movements 
                     have affected how I perceive binaries. My fluidity in gender and sexuality transcribe onto 
                     the shifts of my nation. <br>
                     I am Venezuelan and American. <br>
                     I am nonbinary, Latinx, disabled, and inspired. <br>
                     I am an artist, activist, and student.<br>
                     I am a computer programmer and a philosopher.<br>
                     I have learned, dissected, and created myself through moments of both comfort and lost, and I hope
                     to continue becoming a person I am proud of.  
                </p>
                <h2>SCHOOLING</h2>
                <p>
                    Since 2017, as my main occupation, I have been taking classes at the University of South Carolina pursuing a Bachelors in Computer Science with a minor
                    in philosophy as a <a href="https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/undergraduate_admissions/honors_and_scholars_programs/top_scholars/index.php">Carolina Scholar</a>. 
                    After college I plan to use my knowledge to be a powerful influence in my community
                    as an activist and an artist. I seek to challenge big tech and its negative capital driven efforts
                    by developing platforms for artists and activists, like myself, to rise above their influence and 
                    make real change to protect oppressed minority groups and help the working class prosper.
               </p>
                <h2>MUSIC</h2>
                <p>
                     I write and play music to share and confront my radical ideas and inner conflicts. With my music I seek to 
                     entertain, engage, and teach others about myself and what we need to do stand up for ourselves against individual
                     and systemic abuse. <br>
                     Since 2016, I have using DAWs to record and produce my own original music. I am a self taught musician and producer.
                     I have been creating projects that reflect the different aspects of my life and musical interest. In the music section of 
                     this website I have my entire timeline of musical writing available for streaming.<br>
                     In addition to writing my own music, I have also played with several highschool and college concert bands, a highschool
                     marching band, youth and symphonic orchestras, college level jazz bands, and several local garage style bands since I was
                     10 years old. I mainly focus on percussion instruments with an emphasis on drumset and can play several string instruments like
                     guitar, bass, banjo, and ukulele.
               </p>
                <h2>VISUAL ART</h2>
                <p>
                    My visual art projects are informed by music, science, and literature. I seek to create art
                    that helps me better understand the unity of my interests. I have never formally studied
                    visual art, however it is also a field that I study through my reflections. <br>
                    In the visual art section on this website I make available some of my pieces for viewing. While
                    this craft has not been one of primary interest among my other interest, I believe that it tells
                    a version of my story with insights otherwise unrecognized.
