            <h1>Becoming Latino</h1>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>>
            <p>Reading Latinx literature throughout this semester has taught me how migration affects one’s notion of temporality. Some migrants never stop moving. I want to trace how my movements have affected how I perceive binaries. I want to know how my fluidity in gender and age transcribe onto the shifts of my nation. I want to explore how others who do not move see my movement.</p>

                    “La vaca Mariposa tuvo un terné <br>
Un becerrito lindo como un bebé <br>
"Damelo papaito" dicen los niños cuando lo ven nacer <br>
y ella lo esconde por los mogotes que no sé <br>
La vaca Mariposa tuvo un terné <br>
La sabana le ofrece reverdecer <br>
Los arroyitos todos le llevan flores por el amanecer <br>
y ella lo esconde por los mogotes que no sé <br>
La vaca Mariposa tuvo un terné <br>
Y los pericos van y el gavilan también <br>

Con frutas criollas hasta el caney, para él <br>

Y mariposa está que no sabe qué hacer <br>
Porque ella sabe la suerte de él” <br>
<i>-La Vaca Mariposa, Simon Diaz</i>

                <p>“The cow Butterfly had a calf <br>
                    A very pretty calf like a baby <br>
                    “Give him to me Papaito” the kids say when they see him born <br>
                    And she hides him in the hills out of sight <br>
                    The cow Butterfly had a calf <br>
                    The Savannah offers new life <br>
                    All the little streams bring him flowers at dawn <br>
                    And she hides him in the hills out of sight <br>
                    The cow Butterfly had a calf <br>
                    And the parakeets go and the sparrow hawk too <br>
                    With local fruits all the way to the log cabin <br>
                    And Butterfly doesn’t know what to do <br>
                    Because she knows his fate”

                My mother never directly tells me that I hurt her. She would announce it such that it is a truth and no matter the context or the affect, that truth would be absolutely true. Such an announcement does not need response. <br>
If she told me directly maybe I could.  <br>
She sneaks her messages into songs and dances: “A mother has little love for a son who did not give her pain” <br>
In the states she is both my mother and mi abuelita. <br>
I can’t help but romanticize her. <br>
<br>
These past few years, at least more so than the few years prior, I have taken on the ambiguous life. <br>
Subjectivity is a sword. <br>
The middle is not the middle point, or a point at all. <br>
Few things are more fundamental than time, space, and community. Each is their own dimension and if you are lucky you maintain a single combination of the three. <br>
<br>
I tested my placement. Erasing stillness so that movement is the adjective of my space. <br>
When I was walking alone I heard chirps of “Sir.” As I turned the chirps switched to “mam.” This was the first time I felt a multidimensional shift. <br>
Though I had moved everyone else stayed in their place. Gender was left in the last dimension. <br>
The parakeet asked me for my age, amazed, that someone who looks so young could be a college student. <br> 
In what temporal reality is it possible for me to perform without question? <br>
The first parakeet could not understand that I did not have a gender and the second could not understand that if I could not have an age, I would most definitely opt out. <br>
For most, mathematics is an absolute truth. But yet, when I tell them I am twenty, they don’t seem to understand. <br>
“The still” fail to recognize that different parts of a pattern depend on one another and were one to shift, as it desires, the rest are bound to gain inertia. <br>
<br>
The parakeet asked me if I am from Eastern Asia. <br>
I tell him I am Latino. <br>
I leave out my x. <br>
In this realm those identities take up the same space like sugar and water. <br>
I tell the parakeet that in other realms I exist outside of that space. <br>
The parakeet practices rhetoric. Don’t binaries only have an interior space? <br>
<br>
My mother is both my mother and mi abuelita. <br>
Because family is important. And if your family is trapped within a border, you imagine them in others. Their forms are not unique. <br>
My Latinidad sometimes get brought into question. <br>
The questions take on sentience. <br>
My mother knows my fate. <br>
In the realms of others, my people live with gas masks on the streets. <br>
They surround themselves with bombs. <br>
My people do not know who they are. <br>
<br>
We do not have access to ourselves in Venezuela. <br>
<br>
Information is distributed intra-dimensionally. The displaced are outside of that space.<br>
I am displaced. I never did think of myself as Venezuelan until I started to dislike the Eagle. <br>
One time I moved from one realm to another. <br>
Simon Bolivar walked me through my heritage. <br>
He would laugh at me when I spoke Spanish because I cannot roll my Rs. <br>
I told him that in some realms I am as real as my mother. <br>
<br>
My mom also buys pizza every Thursday from Papa Johns. <br>
She has a waffle maker but instead of making waffles it makes arepas. <br>
It takes in balls of corn flour and returns <br>
A Venezuela rid of un dictador! <br>
I preferred the pizza to arepas. <br>
<br>
Sometimes I do not know my gender the same way I do not know my nationality. <br>
I wonder if I can project one onto the other. <br>
Maybe there is a loop. <br>
There is a point where one starts. <br>
A point where it stops. <br>
And a point where it begins again. <br>
<br>
I move through my Latinidad the way my parents moved through South America. <br>
I move through my gender the way my parents moved through Florida. <br>
<br>
I wonder if a migrant can ever be still. <br>
<br>
When I was four, my parents woke me up late into the night. I could not see and I did not want to. We listened to “La Vaca Mariposa” on the way to the airport. I dreamt the flight. <br>
<br>
A migrant can never be still. <br>
<br>
My mother feared my fate.
